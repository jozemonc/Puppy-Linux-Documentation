## Introduction

Puppy Linux is a lightweight and user-friendly Linux distribution. It is designed to be easy to use and quick to boot. This documentation will guide you through the installation process and provide insights into system call implementations, making it a great resource for both new and experienced users.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation, ensure you have the following:

- A USB drive (at least 2GB)
- A computer that supports booting from USB
- Internet connection for downloading the Puppy Linux ISO

### Steps to Install Puppy Linux

1. **Download the ISO File**  
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/jozemonc/Puppy-Linux-Documentation/releases) to download the latest Puppy Linux ISO file. This file needs to be downloaded and executed to create a bootable USB.

2. **Create a Bootable USB Drive**  
   Use a tool like Rufus (for Windows) or Etcher (for Mac and Linux) to create a bootable USB drive. Select the downloaded ISO file and follow the prompts to complete the process.

3. **Boot from USB**  
   Insert the USB drive into your computer and restart. Access the boot menu (usually by pressing F12, F10, or Esc) and select the USB drive.

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**  
   Puppy Linux will load, and you will see a welcome screen. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

5. **Complete Installation**  
   After installation, you can customize your Puppy Linux environment according to your preferences.

### Post-Installation Tips

- **Explore the Desktop**: Familiarize yourself with the desktop environment.
- **Install Additional Software**: Use the built-in package manager to install any additional software you may need.
- **Backup Your System**: Regularly backup your data to avoid any loss.

## System Call Implementation

### Understanding System Calls

System calls provide the interface between user applications and the operating system. They allow programs to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process management, and network communication.

### Common System Calls in Linux

1. **open()**: Opens a file.
2. **read()**: Reads data from a file descriptor.
3. **write()**: Writes data to a file descriptor.
4. **close()**: Closes a file descriptor.
5. **fork()**: Creates a new process.

### Example: Implementing a Simple System Call

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to implement a system call in Puppy Linux:

1. **Create a C File**  
   Create a file named `my_syscall.c` and add the following code:

   ```c
   #include <linux/kernel.h>
   #include <linux/syscalls.h>

   SYSCALL_DEFINE1(my_syscall, const char __user *, msg) {
       printk(KERN_INFO "My Syscall: %s\n", msg);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**  
   Use the following command to compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc -o my_syscall my_syscall.c
   ```

3. **Load the Module**  
   Load the module into the kernel:

   ```bash
   insmod my_syscall.ko
   ```

4. **Test the System Call**  
   You can test your system call by writing a small user-space program that calls it.

### Resources for Further Learning

- **Linux Kernel Development**: This book provides in-depth knowledge about kernel development.
- **Linux Man Pages**: Use the `man` command to access documentation for system calls.
